# Chocolate-Scraping-with-Beautiful-Soup
After eating chocolate bars your whole life, I’ve decided to go on a quest to find the greatest chocolate bar in the world.  I have found a website that has over 1700 reviews of chocolate bars from all around the world.  The data is displayed in a table, instead of in a csv or json. Thankfully, we have the power of BeautifulSoup that will help us transform this webpage into a DataFrame that we can manipulate and analyze.  The rating scale is from 1-5, as described in this review guide. A 1 is “unpleasant” chocolate, while a 5 is a bar that transcends “beyond the ordinary limits”.  Some questions we thought about when we found this dataset were:  Where are the best cocoa beans grown? Which countries produce the highest-rated bars? What’s the relationship between cocoa solids percentage and rating?
